| Instantly access MLflow using your CDAO credentials. No forms, no tickets, no waiting. Your work is automatically isolated within your CDAO workspace, ensuring complete project privacy and multi-tenancy. | Our platform is built on IDA-based Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This ensures that only authorised users can access specific experiments, models, and workspaces, meeting all internal security and compliance standards. | Get all the features you love from open-source MLflow—tracking, projects, models, and registry—supercharged with the security, support, and seamless integration of an internal, fully managed platform. |

// SECTION 3: GETTING STARTED
{center}
h2. Get Started in Minutes
{center}

|| Step 1: Configure Your Client || Step 2: Start Logging! ||
| Point your MLflow client to our central tracking server. It's one line of code to get started. Just set the tracking URI and your experiment name. | Wrap your training code with `with mlflow.start_run():` and use `mlflow.log_param()` and `mlflow.log_metric()` to track your work. It's that simple. |
| {code:language=python}
import mlflow

# 1. Set the central tracking URI
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("https://your-internal-mlflow-server.com")

# 2. Set your experiment.
# This will be created within your CDAO workspace.
mlflow.set_experiment("My First Awesome Project")
{code} | {code:language=python}
# Log a run under the current experiment
with mlflow.start_run() as run:
    print(f"Run ID: {run.info.run_id}")

    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.01)

    # Log metrics
    for i in range(5):
        mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.85 + i/100)
    
    print("Run logged successfully!")
